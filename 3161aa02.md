# Behavior

Behavior = Motivation + Ability + Trigger

We need to have all three at the same time in order to act

Behavior = ~~Motivation~~ + Ability + Trigger

- To build motivation we need to be reminded of our why, why do you need to do it?
- Add personal meaningful reasons to the task that you put off, make yourelf remember why you took them on.

Behavior = Motivation + ~~Ability~~ + Trigger
- Turn the difficulty dial down by focusing on small steps, breaking down complex tasks
- Break it down by creating a timeline, add due dates and work backwards
1. Start with the due date
2. Go back day by day, write down what you like to have due by then until you arrive today
3. Create the timeline put it in a place you will see it
4. Start working on first piece of puzzle

Behavior = Motivation + Ability + ~~Trigger~~

- Define a concrete trigger that will help you start work

- Create a cue

At the end of the workday, determine where you want to start the next day and put it into your calendar

In situation X, I will do behavior Y to achieve subgoal Z

Examples:

Want to start with a brainstorm?

- Take a sheet of paper, write the topic on it's center and place on desk so that it's the first thing you see tomorrow morning

- Define a specific task to do at a specific place, at a specific moment in time and don't miss the cue
