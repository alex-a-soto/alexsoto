# MySudo

MySudo allows you to create and manage multiple Sudos or identities each with a phone number and email address and optionally you can use the private browser and virtual payment cards.

When MySudo is installed for the first time it generates a public/private key pair on the device. The private keys are stored in the mobile devices specific key storage and the public keys are uploaded to the sudo platform.

Any SMS and email that's received by the platform is encrypted before being stored in the sudo platform and delivered to the device. MySudo uses AES-256 data encryption key (DEK) that's generated by the sudo platform.
