# Signal Protocol

The Signal Protocol is a protocol that can be used to provide end-to-end encryption for voice, calls, video calls and instant messaging conversations. 

The protocol combines the Double Ratchet algorithm, prekeys, and a triple Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (3-DH) handshake, and uses Curve25519, AES-256, and HMAC-SHA256 as primitives. 

In regards to metadata, the Signal Protocol does not prevent a company from retaining information about when and with whom users communicate. There can therefore be differences in how messaging service providers choose to handle this information. The protocol has been implemented in closed-source applications, such as WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Skype.

Signal Messenger maintains the following Signal Protocol libraries under the GPLv3 license on GitHub:

    libsignal-protocol-c: A library written in C with additional licensing permissions for Apple's App Store.
    libsignal-protocol-java: A library written in Java.
    libsignal-protocol-javascript: A library written in JavaScript.
