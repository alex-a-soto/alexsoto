## About
![](static/profile.jpeg){#avatar .ui .left .floated .small .image}

Hi, I’m Alexander Soto.

I’m a community organizer, educator, software engineer, hacktivist, and agent of social change. My interests are in exploring community-building, social justice, education, and leveraging technology to address social problems.

In the past, I’ve worked as a labor rights organizer, a teacher, and I’m currently the Project Lead at [EI2030](https://ei2030.org/), an Expert In Residence at [Resilient Coders](https://www.resilientcoders.org/), and founder of [Modos](https://www.modos.tech/).

I enjoy tinkering/playing/breaking things, 3D printing, painting, playing piano, swimming, and writing in my spare time.

This site is the [scattered and unfinished version of my thoughts](https://alexsoto.dev/impulse.html) while documenting what I’m currently learning and exploring.

If you’d like to know the updates of a post, have questions, comments, suggestions, or would like to collaborate, send me a [direct message](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=4648173315) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexsotodev), or an [email](mailto:contact@alexsoto.dev) and we can talk.
