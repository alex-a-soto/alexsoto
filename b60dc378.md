# Imagination

Imagination is shaped by our entire life experience, our socialization, the concepts we are exposed to, wher we fall in the global hierarchies of society.

We are in an imagination battle. Imagination gives us borders, gives us superiority, gives us race as an indicator of capability.

People often feel trapped inside someone else's imagination and I must engage my own imagination in order to break free.

We must imagine new worlds that transition ideologies and norms from our preconceived biases.

We are living in the ancestral imagination of others.
