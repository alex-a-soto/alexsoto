## Background
Since the E Ink Corporation's founding in 1997 and the patenting of its microencapsulated electrophoretic display, or epaper, manufacturers started to incorporate e-ink film into consumer devices. [^eink-founding]. Some of the first consumer devices where eink displays were found were ereaders: The Sony Librie in 2004[^sony] and Amazon Kindle in 2007 [^kindle].

Throughout the years, we've seen eink prototypes showcased in tech shows: eink-film used with larger screens, color, flexibility and most recently have started seeing eink displays being used in smartphones and tablets, notably from Hisense and Boox[^gpl] product lines. And while eink has been around for 24 years, we have yet to see a laptop with an eink panel.


## Why isn't there an E Ink Laptop?
There have been attempts in the past to create a similar device: Pixel Qi and OLPC[^pixelqi], Boox Typewriter[^boox typewriter], Yoga Book C930[^C930] and ThinkBook Plus. These attempts did not materialize, were discontinued, or were not sufficiently suitable to meet the demands of users due to hardware or lack of a cohesive UX/UI paradigm. To make matters worse, the E Ink Corporation's holds the patents for it's eink technology and only licenses it's technology to large manafacturers making availability or mass adoption difficult.[^patent]

Fortunately, some of the most exciting work and innovation happening today is in the eink modding community. There have been attempts at re-purposing ereaders: as a calendar and used to display a static image or site. We've seen Kobo devices running GNU/Linux, The Amazon Kindle devices being repurposed as a development platform, the Remarkable 1 and 2 running Linux under the hood, and PINE 64 recently announcing a native e-ink single board computer[^pine64].

## Creating an E Ink Laptop
In my quest of creating an e-ink laptop, I've decided to use a 'headless' Thinkpad T480 [^pi] and a Dasung HD-FT [^dasung].

### Thinkpad T480
The Thinkpad T480, seems to be an ideal laptop for building an eink laptop, The T480 has[^t480]:

- A hot-swappable battery (an internal and external).
- With the 72Wh battery up 13 hours of battery or more with web browsing.
- Supports up to 64 GB of ram
- Two Nvme drives (type 2280 and 2242).
- Standard HDMI port, USB-C, Thunderbolt 3, Headphone jack, Ethernet and SD cart slot.
- Uses a standard USB-C charger. [^thinkplus]
- Lightweight and portable
- Can be modded to use the classic 7-row keyboard. [^xytech]

The T480 will be an upgrade over my modded Thinkpad X230 and become my daily driver for the next few years.


### Dasung HD-FT
Why choose the Dasung HD-FT, what makes it stand-out
