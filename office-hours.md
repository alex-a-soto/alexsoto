# Office Hours


Are you interested in [building an open-source e-ink laptop](https://alexsoto.dev/challenges-building-an-open-source-eink-laptop.html)? How about making one with a [community](https://forum.ei2030.org/t/about-ei2030-working-groups/132)?

Please book a session if you would like to talk about any of the following:
- Learning more about the EI2030 Working Groups
- Wanting to start or propose a working group.
- Contributing and or supporting a group.
- E-Ink or related technologies.

These office hours are my attempt to generate interest about building an e-ink laptop and connecting people together.

Join our community on [Zulip](https://ei2030.zulipchat.com/register/) to learn more.

Currently, accepting invitations at meetups, talks, conferences, etc.
