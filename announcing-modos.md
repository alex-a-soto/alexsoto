# Announcing Modos

![](static/announcing-modos/modos-logo.png){.ui .centered .large .image}

From the moment we wake up until we fall asleep, we are staring at our devices, causing eyestrain, discomfort, and exhaustion. We live in a digital world filled with noise where we are constantly distracted – jeopardizing our health, relationships with ourselves, friends, family, and the world around us.

Modos is an open-source hardware and software company, project, and community that designs, manufactures, and sells digital devices that respect users’ time, attention, and well-being.

We are united in our belief that we must create a healthier and humane relationship with our digital devices and make them accessible to everyone. We believe technology should:

Be Humane

Our digital devices are transforming us, and we believe technology should be a tool to serve our needs and support our humanity and overall well-being.

Center Relationships

We want to support you in having a healthier relationship with technology, allowing you to focus on what matters most to you, together, let's rethink our relationship with technology and how we interact with people and in society.

Open and Transparent

From the bottom-up, we are an open-hardware and open-source company, from the prototypes we make to our software and tools. We are a small team from all over the world that values open-source.

Follow our progress on RSS, Github, Matrix, Mastodon, and Twitter.

Regards,

The Modos Team

## About
![](static/profile.jpeg){#avatar .ui .left .floated .small .image}

Hi, I’m Alexander Soto.

I’m a community organizer, educator, software engineer, hacktivist, and agent of social change. My interests are in exploring community-building, social justice, education, and leveraging technology to address social problems.

In the past, I’ve worked as a labor rights organizer, a teacher, and I’m currently the Project Lead at [EI2030](https://ei2030.org/), an Expert In Residence at [Resilient Coders](https://www.resilientcoders.org/), and founder of [Modos](https://www.modos.tech/).

I enjoy tinkering/playing/breaking things, 3D printing, painting, playing piano, swimming, and writing in my spare time.

This site is the [scattered and unfinished version of my thoughts](https://alexsoto.dev/impulse.html) while documenting what I’m currently learning and exploring.

If you’d like to know the updates of a post, have questions, comments, suggestions, or would like to collaborate, send me a [direct message](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=4648173315) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexsotodev), or an [email](mailto:contact@alexsoto.dev) and we can talk.
