Hi, I'm Alexander Soto.

I'm a community organizer, educator, software engineer, hacktivist and agent of social change. My interests are in exploring issues in community-building, social justice, education and leveraging technology to address social problems.

In the past I've worked as a labor rights organizer, a teacher at the Margarita Mu√±iz Academy and I'm currently an Expert In Residence at [Resilient Coders.](https://www.resilientcoders.org/)

This site is the [scattered and unfinished version of my thoughts](https://alexsoto.dev/impulse.html) while documenting what I'm currently learning and exploring.

If a note resonates with you, or if you strongly disagree, please let me know. Send me a [direct message](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=4648173315) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexsoto_dev) and we can talk.
