My name is Alexander Soto. I'm an activist, educator, technologist and agent of social change. My interests are in exploring issues in community-building, social justice, education and leveraging technology to address social problems.

In the past I've worked as a labor rights organizer, an AmeriCorps member with United Way, a technology teacher at the Margarita Mu√±iz Academy and I'm currently an Expert In Residence at [Resilient Coders.](http://www.resilientcoders.org/)

This site is a collection of my thoughts on the intersection of technology and social justice while also documenting what I'm currently learning.
