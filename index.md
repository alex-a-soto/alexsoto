Hi, I’m Alexander Soto.

I’m a community organizer, educator, software engineer, hacktivist, and agent of social change. My interests are in exploring community-building, social justice, education, and leveraging technology to address social problems.

In the past, I’ve worked as a labor rights organizer, a teacher at the Margarita Muñiz Academy, and I’m currently an Expert In Residence at [Resilient Coders.](https://www.resilientcoders.org/).

I enjoy tinkering/playing/breaking things, 3D printing, painting, playing piano, swimming, and writing in my spare time.

This site is the [scattered and unfinished version of my thoughts](https://alexsoto.dev/impulse.html) while documenting what I’m currently learning and exploring.

If a post resonated positively or negatively, send me a [direct message](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=4648173315) on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/alexsoto_dev), and we can talk. Also, ping if you’d like to know the updates of a post or if you have suggestions, comments, questions, or would like to collaborate.
