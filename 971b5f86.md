# Birds

Birds don't make a plan to migrate, raising resources to fund their way, picking for scarce times, mapping their stops. Birds feel a call in their bodies that they must go, follow it, respond to each other, bringing their adaptations.

## Flocking
- Separate enough not to crowd each other
- Aligned enough to maintain a shared direction
- Cohesive enough to always move towards each other
